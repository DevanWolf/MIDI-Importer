MIDI Importer v1.0
---------------------------------------------------------

Hi! Thanks for downloading my program and taking the time
to read this.

I'd just like to start off by thanking the producers of
NAudio for their amazing MIDI library, without which
this project would not be possible.

---------------------------------------------------------
Prerequisites
---------------------------------------------------------

You will need to have the Microsoft.Net Framework v4.0
installed on your computer in order to run the program.

You can obtain a copy here:

---------------------------------------------------------
Running for the first time
---------------------------------------------------------

On Windows 8 and above, the first time you run the
program you may see the Windows SmartScreen filter pop
up, blocking the application.

If this happens, you need to click on 'More info' and
select 'Run anyway'

---------------------------------------------------------
Using the program
---------------------------------------------------------

Click load and find the .mid file you want to import
into Scratch.

Then, for each of the tracks, select which Scratch voice
you want to use for it by clicking on the dropdown. You
can also mute tracks by clicking on the 'mute' checkbox.

If you wish to not save the drum beat, you can uncheck
the tick box for 'Import drum beat'. This is recommended
if your midi file does not have any drum beat.

---------------------------------------------------------
Where will my files be stored
---------------------------------------------------------

When you save an extracted midi file, the data will be
saved to C:\Users\NAME\Documents\MIDI Importer\SONG NAME\

Depending on the options you select, in that folder you
may have up to 11 files:

> Bar Tempo.txt
> Drums - Drum.txt
> Drums - Duration.txt
> Drums - Indexes.txt
> Drums - Start.txt
> Drums - Volume.txt
> Notes - Duration.txt
> Notes - Indexes.txt
> Notes - Pitch.txt
> Notes - Start.txt
> Notes - Voice.txt
> Notes - Volume.txt

Each file will contain data about your song and when you
import the song each file will need to be uploaded.

To simplify the process I have put a step by step
importer in the project to help you along the way.
